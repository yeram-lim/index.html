<p>Korea (or Korean Peninsula) is a region in East Asia. Since 1945 it has been divided into two sovereign states: North Korea (officially the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea") and South Korea (officially the "Republic of Korea"). Korea consists of the mainland Korea ("mainland Korean Peninsula"), Jeju Island, and several minor islands near the peninsula. It is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea).</p>
